# PMP Engine
## Package for the PMP ZZ Vienna group

I put together this R package to give our team a solid foundation for building portfolio management tools. As a portfolio manager, I wanted to create a codebase that we could use and expand on. The package covers the basics of portfolio analysis, so it's a great starting point for our projects.

How to install: make sure you have the package `devtools` installed, then run
## `install_github("Jaekoeb/pmp.engine")`
